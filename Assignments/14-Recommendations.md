# Recommendations for Future Students

1. When selecting a microcontroller, make sure you have a solid understanding of all the pins' capabilities in I2C and SPI.
2. Prioritize using components the person in charge of them has had experience using before or has similarities to components they have experience with.
3. Ensure dimensions of parts are checked thoroughly before ordering as parts being too small may be an issue when soldering.
4. Have as many device inputs and outputs print to Putty to dramatically increase the effectiveness of the debugging stage of development.
5. If a team member is willing to make the investment, buying a heat gun and personal flux and solder can dramatically reduce frustration when soldering surface-mount IC's.
