### Team Communication Table

| Name  | 1st Choice | 2nd Choice | 3rd Choice |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| Brian | Discord    | Text       | Email      |
| Zeke  | Discord    | Text       | Slack      |
| Kevis | Discord    | Text       | Email      |
| Fynn  | Text       | Discord    | Zoom       |

Team 301 will be using a PACE (Primary, Alternative, Contingency, Emergency) plan as the model for determining team communications. The team's preferred methods of communication match most closely with the PACE plan. Team members will establish communications using the primary method first, then working through subsequent alternatives until communication is established.

### PACE Plan

  -  **Discord** (Primary):
    - Main channel for regular team communications.

  -  **Short Message Service (SMS) / Text** (Alternative): 
    - For quick updates and when Discord is not available.
      
  -  **E-mail** (Contingency):
    - For more formal or detailed communication needs.

  -  **Face-to-Face during Class** (Emergency):
    - For urgent matters requiring immediate, in-person discussion.

## 3. Communication Procedures

As per the PACE plan, team members will prioritize methods of communication using this plan. The team will first attempt to communicate through Discord, and if that's not possible, we will move to Text, and so on. This approach ensures all team members stay on track and are aware of which communication methods to use as a fallback if the first option is not available.

### Managing Instructor Correspondence

- **Collaborative Approach:**
  - The team adopts a collaborative strategy to ensure effective communication and timely resolution of queries.
- **Designated Point of Contact:**
  - *Peralta 103* is designated as the individual responsible for handling instructor correspondence, acting as a liaison between the team and the instructors.
- **Maximizing Office Hours:**
  - The team commits to utilizing instructor office hours as much as possible to stay updated on assignments and project deadlines.

    ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/314-grp-301/314-grp-301.github.io/main/docs/assets/images/01-graph.png)

### Stages of Team Development:

1. **Forming:** Getting to know each other, understanding the teamâ€™s purpose, structure, and leadership.

2. **Storming:** Conflict arises as roles and opinions emerge. It's crucial for growth, but shouldn't be prolonged.

3. **Norming:** Recognizing and resolving differences, establishing norms and roles. Unity begins to form.

4. **Performing:** The team works smoothly, focusing on team goals with independent action.

5. **Adjourning:** The final stage of dissolution, aiming for closure and maintaining future cooperation potential.

### Detail-Oriented Strategy:

- **Conflict Intervention:** Strategies vary depending on the situation and individuals involved.

- **Counseling as a Tool:** Improve the team memberâ€™s contribution, not to admonish.

**Conflict Resolution and Counseling Guide:**

1. **Identify the Problem:** 
  - Clearly state the issue at hand.

2. **Identify Solutions:** 
  - Suggest practical solutions.

3. **Counseling Techniques:**
  - Active Listening, Empathy, Confidentiality, Goal Setting, Providing Resources.

4. **Resolution Approaches:**

   1. ** Peer-to-Peer:** 
   - *First-level, professional one-on-one communication.*

   2. ** Team-to-Peer:**
   - *A team approach is used, avoiding alienation.*

   3. ** Instructor-to-Team:**
   - *Escalation for unresolved issues, involving the professor.*
