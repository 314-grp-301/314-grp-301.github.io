## 1. Team Organization

### Introduction
Teams serve as the backbone of engineering projects by facilitating collaborative efforts and pooling individual contributions to tackle tasks that would normally overwhelm a single individual. By leveraging expertise and experiences, team members can collectively navigate complex problems. Each member adds a unique perspective and various skill sets that add value to their team and project. Through this synergy, teams provide a foundation of support to other team members by offering mentorship, shared learning, and fostering personal relationships that often improve the overall performance of the team.

### Mission Statement
“Our mission is to improve weather reporting by designing and implementing solutions that provide localized, real-time weather data in a wide range of environments and conditions. With a user focused experience in mind, our goal is to provide end users with the tools needed to make the necessary and informed decisions required in their daily activity planning.”

### Project Goals
- **Design Safety Device:** Design and fabricate a device capable of provoding an end-user with accurate and precise temperature and humidity readings.

### 7 Shared Goals
1. **Improve in Designing for Widespread Use:**
   - Focus on creating designs that are universally accessible and usable.
2. **Cater to Needs of the User:**
   - Prioritize user experience and user-centric design in our solutions.
3. **Build Network:**
   - Expand our professional and collaborative network for better outreach and resources.
4. **Practice Using a New Microcontroller:**
   - Enhance technical skills by experimenting with various microcontrollers.
5. **Continue Practice in PCB Creation:**
   - Develop expertise in printed circuit board design and manufacturing.
6. **Optimize Designs for Scalability and Adaptability:**
    - Create solutions that can be easily scaled and adapted to different environments and needs.
7. **Continuous Improvement in Design Processes:**
    - Commit to an iterative process of design improvement and refinement.<br><br>
