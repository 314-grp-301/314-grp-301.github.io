## :peace_symbol: 7. Conflict Recognition & Resolution

### Big Picture Strategy:

- **Recognizing Conflict:**
  - **Goal:** Aid in team development by transitioning through stages efficiently, aiming to spend most time in the performing stage.
  - **Tuckman’s Five Stages of Team Development:**
    - Illustrated in Fig 1.

### Stages of Team Development:

1. **Forming:** Getting to know each other, understanding the team’s purpose, structure, and leadership.

2. **Storming:** Conflict arises as roles and opinions emerge. It's crucial for growth, but shouldn't be prolonged.

3. **Norming:** Recognizing and resolving differences, establishing norms and roles. Unity begins to form.

4. **Performing:** The team works smoothly, focusing on team goals with independent action.

5. **Adjourning:** The final stage of dissolution, aiming for closure and maintaining future cooperation potential.

### Detail-Oriented Strategy:

- **Conflict Intervention:** Strategies vary depending on the situation and individuals involved.

- **Counseling as a Tool:** Improve the team member’s contribution, not to admonish.

**Conflict Resolution and Counseling Guide:**

- **Identify the Problem:** 
  - Clearly state the issue at hand.

- **Identify Solutions:** 
  - Suggest practical solutions.

- **Counseling Techniques:**
  - Active Listening, Empathy, Confidentiality, Goal Setting, Providing Resources.

- **Resolution Approaches:**
  - **Peer-to-Peer:** First-level, professional one-on-one communication.
  - **Team-to-Peer:** If peer-to-peer fails, a team approach is used, avoiding alienation.
  - **Instructor-to-Team:** Escalation for unresolved issues, involving the professor.
  - **Instructor-to-Peer:** Final step for unresolved conflicts requiring outside intervention.
