## 2. Sort, Rank, and Group Design Concepts
Here are two tables organizing our brainstorming ideas/concepts/features into six different categories. They are ranked by interest level, indicated by the following colors:
- ðŸŸ  Orange for highest interest
- ðŸŸ¢ Green for neutral interest
- âšª Gray for lowest interest

**Description**

This portable weather pod features a simple and compact design, equipped with several advanced features. It includes an onboard LCD screen displaying data from various environmental sensors. 
The pod's customizable skin (camouflage shown) allows the user to blend it seamlessly into the appropriate environment.

**:zap: Key Features**

- **Solar Powered:** Utilizes solar energy for efficient power use.
- **Portable:** Easy to move and install in various locations.
- **LCD Display:** Clear and informative data presentation.
- **Speaker:** Audio feedback for alerts and notifications.
- **Full Weatherproof:** Designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions.
- **5-in-One Sensor:** Multi-functional sensor for comprehensive environmental data.
  - **Temperature:** Measures ambient temperature accurately.
  - **Humidity:** Monitors air moisture levels.
  - **Barometric:** Provides pressure readings.
  - **Wind:** Measures wind speed and direction.
  - **Rain:** Detects precipitation and rain intensity.

### Concept 2: Portable Adverse Weather Detection System
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/314-grp-301/314-grp-301.github.io/main/docs/assets/images/03-concept2a.png)

**Description**

The Portable Adverse Weather Detection System serves as an early warning and monitoring system for adverse weather conditions and flash flooding. Incorporated with other detection systems, it provides emergency management services (EMS) with the capability to detect and monitor areas at risk of flash flooding. This service offers EMS real-time data of ground conditions, aiding in delivering more accurate weather warnings to the public and responding to emergencies as required.

**:zap: Features**

- **Solar Power with Battery Backup:** Ensures continuous operation, independent of external power sources.
- **Adjustable Solar Panel (Motorized):** Solar panel adjusts automatically according to the time of day for optimal energy capture.
- **Precipitation Detection and Monitoring (Sensor 1):** Accurately detects and monitors rainfall and other forms of precipitation.
- **Ambient Air Temperature (Sensor 2):** Measures and records the ambient air temperature.
- **Remote Access (WiFi):** Allows for remote monitoring and control via WiFi connectivity.
  
### Concept 3: Waterway Weather and Flash Flood Detection Buoy
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/314-grp-301/314-grp-301.github.io/main/docs/assets/images/03-concept3a.png)

**Description**

The Waterway Weather and Flash Flood Detection Buoy would serve a similar purpose as Concept 2, but be housed in a waterway. It wirelessly communicates temperature, humidity, water flow rate, and change in water level over time. Not only providing present values, it is also programmed to send out alerts for various conditions like sudden rises or falls in water flow rate and water level. This enables it to issue flash flood warnings or other preset alarms based on a target baseline. The device is waterproof and capable of detecting when it's submerged, with basic mechanisms to surface itself.

**:zap: Features**

- **Sensors:**
  - **Temperature:** Measures ambient temperature.
  - **Humidity:** Monitors air moisture levels around the waterway.
  - **Pressure (Directed Towards Expected Water Flow):** Used to determine water flow-rate.
  - **Movement:** Tracks height and changes in water level.
- **Motor-Controlled Height Adjustment:** Attached to an installed rod, allows the buoy to adjust its height relative to water level.
