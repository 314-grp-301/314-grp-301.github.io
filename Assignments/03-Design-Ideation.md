# Design Ideation

## Introduction

Design ideation is a crucial stage in the creative process, where diverse ideas are generated through brainstorming sessions. The objective is to produce a wide array of innovative concepts that may serve as springboards for further exploration. While individual ideas hold value, the true innovation process unfolds when these ideas are collected, compared, and juxtaposed, allowing designers to weave together concepts that may have gone unnoticed in isolation. Once a multitude of concepts is amassed, the next step involves sorting, ranking, and grouping ideas to uncover synergies and connections between them, enabling designers to visualize how various concepts can complement and integrate with one another.

The analysis of requirements and potential functionality lead us to concept the designs shown below each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

### Concept 2: Portable Adverse Weather Detection System
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/314-grp-301/314-grp-301.github.io/main/docs/assets/images/03-concept2a.png)

**Description**

The Portable Adverse Weather Detection System serves as an early warning and monitoring system for adverse weather conditions and flash flooding. Incorporated with other detection systems, it provides emergency management services (EMS) with the capability to detect and monitor areas at risk of flash flooding. This service offers EMS real-time data of ground conditions, aiding in delivering more accurate weather warnings to the public and responding to emergencies as required.

**:zap: Features**

- **Solar Power with Battery Backup:** Ensures continuous operation, independent of external power sources.
- **Adjustable Solar Panel (Motorized):** Solar panel adjusts automatically according to the time of day for optimal energy capture.
- **Precipitation Detection and Monitoring (Sensor 1):** Accurately detects and monitors rainfall and other forms of precipitation.
- **Ambient Air Temperature (Sensor 2):** Measures and records the ambient air temperature.
- **Remote Access (WiFi):** Allows for remote monitoring and control via WiFi connectivity.
  
### Concept 3: Waterway Weather and Flash Flood Detection Buoy
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/314-grp-301/314-grp-301.github.io/main/docs/assets/images/03-concept3a.png)

**Description**

The Waterway Weather and Flash Flood Detection Buoy would serve a similar purpose as Concept 2, but be housed in a waterway. It wirelessly communicates temperature, humidity, water flow rate, and change in water level over time. Not only providing present values, it is also programmed to send out alerts for various conditions like sudden rises or falls in water flow rate and water level. This enables it to issue flash flood warnings or other preset alarms based on a target baseline. The device is waterproof and capable of detecting when it's submerged, with basic mechanisms to surface itself.

**:zap: Features**

- **Sensors:**
  - **Temperature:** Measures ambient temperature.
  - **Humidity:** Monitors air moisture levels around the waterway.
  - **Pressure (Directed Towards Expected Water Flow):** Used to determine water flow-rate.
  - **Movement:** Tracks height and changes in water level.
- **Motor-Controlled Height Adjustment:** Attached to an installed rod, allows the buoy to adjust its height relative to water level.<br><br><br>

# Selected Design
Originally we had intended to create a flash flood detection system (Concept 3), but due to potential constraints with the watertight capabilities and the water motion detection system we shifted to the weather pod (Concept 1), kept the general concept and minimized potential shortcomings which resulted in the Portable Weather Pod.

## Final Concept: Portable Weather Pod

**:zap: Key Features**

- **Portable:** Easy to move and install in various locations.
- **Weatherproof:** Designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions.
- **OLED Display:** Clear and informative data presentation.
- **WIFI Capable:** Uses the ESP32 chipset to transmit data to the net.
- **2 Key Sensors:** Multi-functional sensor for comprehensive environmental data.
  - **Temperature:** Measures ambient temperature accurately.
  - **Humidity:** Monitors air moisture levels.
