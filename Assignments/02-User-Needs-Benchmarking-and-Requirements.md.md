Customer Need
“Had it up and running in less than an hour. Only disappointment was that no batteries were included. Other than that, I'm absolutely satisfied. Easy to read and accurate.”
Very easy to use and accessible (Explicit)
“Weather station was installed in my elderly parents' study to give them weather details to help them plan their outdoor activities. It was easy to install and worked well even though their home is a metal building. Works as expected and readings are accurate.”
Easy installation and accurate (Explicit)
“The base unit readout screen is nice, good contrast, lots of information on it, more than we had on the last one. It hasn't rained yet, so we haven't seen how that works yet, but the rest of it has been effective, in comparison to our neighbors and some other readouts we have available nearby. Setting all the options along with date, time, and measurement/unit preferences was quick and easy.”

Customer Need
“We have owned this weather station now for a year and half. Don't buy it. It's a piece of garbage. Wind direction is totally wrong even though I aligned it with the true north. I have twisted it this way or that to try to get it to read the direction correctly, but it has never worked accurately no matter what I do. The rain volume sensor is a joke as it has never been accurate either. There is no wind chill calculation showing on the monitor, which is a handy thing to know when you live in a cold climate as we do. We have owned much more accurate and useful weather stations in the past than this brand. I bought a different brand weather station over Black Friday and plan on mounting it this spring when the weather gets nice again.”
Wind Chill Calculation (Explicit)
“Downgrading to 1 star. Every time I change the batteries(3 months), I'm reminded what a POS this thing is. Now it wont reconnect. It's not mounted in an easy to troubleshoot location. (It's in a good weather recording location). Next stop... TRASH CAN!!”
Troubleshooting Convenience (Latent)
“This weather station worked for a couple of months, then stopped transmitting the outside temperature, wind speed and rainfall. We changed the batteries, went out and bought expensive lithium batteries and the reset button on the unit stayed red, never green like it’s supposed to be!”
Consistent Transmission (Latent)

I particularly appreciate the customizable alerts that notify me of any sudden changes, allowing me to take timely actions.”
Customizable Alerts (Explicit)

Common Negatives Consist Of:

Customer Review
Customer Need
“Bought one same/similar to this from Costco at a much better price. Loved everything about it except the rain gauge. It kept blowing over during storms, so I would be running out during storms to stand it back up only to have it blow over again. I returned it. If you want one that tracks rain, buy a one piece unit with an integrated rain gauge.”
Stability in during Storms (Explicit)
“rain gauge does not collect as much rain as a small tube. Tech support says they are perfect reading almost an inch different on three inches of rain and not reading on a quarter of an inch.”
Accurate Rain Collection in Rain Gauge (Latent)
“Firstly, the Wi-Fi connectivity is inconsistent at best. Despite multiple attempts to set up the connection, the device frequently loses connection, making it unreliable for remote access. This significantly diminishes the convenience factor that comes with a Wi-Fi-enabled weather station.”
Importance of Reliable Wi-Fi for Convenience (Explicit)

“If you are looking for a great weather station at great price this is the perfect unit. This station has all the basics you would want and more. Rain gage that measures not only the amount of rain but hourly rain fall as well as 24 hour rain fall, weekly, monthly and rain event totals. The unit has a wind vain and anemometer for wind direction and speed, of course. It also has temperature with heat index and wind chill. We have a pool so I love that the unit measures UV index and Solar Radiation.”

Accurate Forecasting (Explicit)

“So I take the display apart. Inside clearly labelled on the PCB is the antenna connection, and attached is a loose, 9.5 cm long red wire hanging out in the case (see photo). The antenna is just a small length of red wire. Now I'm not an RF engineer, but 9.5 cm isn't even a length that makes sense for picking up a 915MHz signal, and even worse its bent around a corner of the case so the shape of the wire is even less optimized. Don't get me wrong, you can use a wire like this to pick up a wireless signal it just works really bad and explains the problems people have with reception completely.

To verify this I soldered on a proper sma connector and hacked it into the case (see my photo). Even with an antennae tuned to a completely different spectrum (2.4GHz/wifi) I was getting clear reception from the other side of my house 100% of the time.”


Effective Antenna Design (Latent)
My main complaints are; the only things that are accurate from day one until now are the indoor and outdoor weather and the indoor humidity. I was really looking forward to seeing the wind speed and the rainfall amount. The wind speed has never shown over around 13 mph even when I know we were gettting 40 mph gusts. It is windy enough as I write this that my flag is standing straight out and my station says 4.1-4.6 mph.
Ruggedized/All-Weather (Explicit)
“I bought this to replace my long-serving WS-1001 when it died. The sensors are nice and easy to install. I am not a fan of this new display even though it is color compared to my old one which was B&W. The viewing angle is pretty poor. Although it has mounting holes to enable it to hang on the wall it is very tough to read if hung at picture height. The display really needs to be below eye level. The old display did not have this limitation. And although this is a color display the colors don’t mean anything - they’re static and pretty random. I know how to grab the data from the sensors directly so I think I’ll build my own display.”

“Sensor died within 6 months, zero tech support”
Ruggedized/All-Weather (Explicit)
“Temperature sensor outdoor measures 12 degrees to hot when the sun shines on the sensor. Emailed the manufacture they said this is normal. If you want accurate outdoor temperature you will want a different weather station.”
Accurate Forecasting (Explicit)
The weather forecast is not connected to a weather service but rather overall change in barometric pressure. Which could actually be interesting information as I can get the local forecast other places.

Customer Need
“This truly is the only ‘rain sensor’ that has ever really worked consistently with my smart irrigation controller, and I get all the other great weather station features as well. “
Consistent Rain Sensor for Smart Irrigation (Explicit)
“Temperatures have been spot on, wind readings are responsive and accurate. The lighting detection is unbelievable – you can track storms heading in and leaving with just this feature alone. Highly recommend the new Tempest.”
Effective Storm Tracking with Lightning Detection (Explicit)
“I recently switched from my old Davis Vantage Pro to the Tempest, and overall, I'm pleased with the decision. The build is solid, and the readings are accurate, but I miss the convenience of a remote console in the kitchen for a quick and easy summary of the station's data, a feature lacking in the Tempest. Despite this, I don't mind the rain adjustments based on local stations' data, which some users complain about, as it can be turned off if desired.”
Desire for Convenient Remote Console (Latent)















Common Negatives Consist Of:
Customer Review
Customer Need
“Everything worked seamlessly for several days until I got a message on Saturday about a data update issue. Spent four frustrating hours troubleshooting online, checking and rechecking everything. Turns out, the problem was a "Pressure Failed" sensor, and despite multiple attempts to fix it, I ended up packing the $350+ unit for return by Monday, disappointed that it failed so quickly.”
Reliable Performance (Explicit) 
“Living in a consistently rainy area with varying precipitation amounts, I've been disappointed with the Tempest's accuracy in representing rainfall over the 18 months it's been installed, finding it to be greatly underrepresented and expressing regret over the decision to use the tool.”
Accurate Rainfall Representation (Explicit)
"Despite the initial hype, this weather station proves ineffective in northern climates, requiring excessive winter sunlight, providing inaccurate measurements, and lacking satisfactory customer support, leading the user to suggest investing in more established brands.”
Climate-Adaptive Functionality (Explicit)

 (Link) - Weather station to detect weather stats


Price: Unlisted - Priced at Order
Vendor: OTT Hydromet
The OT HydroMet Urban Flood Warning System has been included as an extra search option despite it not having product and/or review data that aligns with this assignment. It has been included, despite the missing data, as a direct to consumer made item by the company. The device is designed for government services, not for regular private use. Because of this, there are a lack of private user reviews as the product was not designed to be sold to them.
The system has been included since it is a close representation of the intended finished product aimed at non-commercial use. This aligns with the conceptual idea of an early warning flood detection system to detect and warn civilian populations of localized flooding conditions for emergency management.
